/*
    Game created (soon) by Samuel Palmér.

    This game is a collection of Text-Or-Die and Wordle and it is inspired by my phone games and people playing Wordle.
    I decided to program both as I have been trying to decide what game to do, but I really can't...

    This was created for my assignment : "Slutprojektet".
